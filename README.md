# TankWars
A two player tank game written in Java. My finest game in the Java language!

##BUILDING

`make build`

##RUNNING


`make run`

##PLAYING
This is a turn by turn game
* Choose muzzle velocity (controls speed of projectile)
* Choose Quadrant Elevation (determines angle of the shot)
* Press FIRE to shoot

Players continue until one tank is at 0 health
